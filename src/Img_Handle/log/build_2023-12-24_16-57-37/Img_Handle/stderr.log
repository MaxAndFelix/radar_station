[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmy_msgss.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "my_msgss",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "my_msgss" with any
  of the following names:

    my_msgssConfig.cmake
    my_msgss-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "my_msgss" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "my_msgss_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "my_msgss" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
