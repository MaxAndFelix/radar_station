[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmy_msgss_DIR.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "my_msgss_DIR", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "my_msgss_DIR" with
  any of the following names:

    my_msgss_DIRConfig.cmake
    my_msgss_dir-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "my_msgss_DIR" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "my_msgss_DIR_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "my_msgss_DIR" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
